| Nov 15 |   2:30-3:00pm   |                                                                                                                            I worked with Liliana to come up with an algorithm. At first, we wanted to encode everything as floats in terms of long sequences of bits. For example, if there was a sequence of 32 0s, we would write it as 32.0. However, this would only properly compress if there were a lot of long sequences, and there aren't for our data. |
| Nov 18 |  12:40-1:20pm   | I continued trying to come up with an algorithm. I think I am going to modify the idea that Liliana & I came up with and instead work with sequences up to 16 bits. I will write it as "0" or "1," followed by the number of instances as a 4-bit binary number. This means that every sequence should take up 5 bits, regardless of length. For the vast majority of sequences, this will save space, although there are a few where this would add extra bits. |

I am getting an error, and I think it's in the way I am reading from the BinaryStdIn file. |
| Nov 21 |  10:00-10:30am  |                                                                                                          I checked in with Mr. Blick, and he confirmed my suspicions and told me how I could fix it. Instead of reading from the file as a String, I should read it one bit at a time. I also removed a for loop so I can rely only on a while loop. Right now, it doesn't work and has a really high (bad) ratio. I will keep working to try and figure it out. |
