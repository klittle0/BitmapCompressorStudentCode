At first, we wanted to encode everything as floats in terms of long sequences of bits. For example, if there was a sequence of 32 0s, we would write it as 32.0. However, this would only properly compress if there were a lot of long sequences, and there aren't for our data. |
| Nov 18 | 12:40-1:20pm | I continued trying to come up with an algorithm. I think I am going to modify the idea that Liliana & I came up with and instead work with sequences up to 16 bits. I will write it as "0" or "1," followed by the number of instances as a 4-bit binary number. This means that every sequence should take up 5 bits, regardless of length. For the vast majority of sequences, this will save space, although there are a few where this would add extra bits. |
